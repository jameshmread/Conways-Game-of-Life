# Conways-Game-of-Life
A simulation of population dynamics using a small set of rules.

I created this for fun in 2015.

Source Code files to look at:

Game of Life/Algorithm.cs (uses set of rules to alter cells)

Game of Life/DisplayRule.cs (takes input from algorithm to update the grid)

Game of Life/Form1.cs (creation of buttons on form)

To play:
Click boxes to set them to 'Alive' or 'Dead' (red/white).
Then click button to the right of grid to advance a generation.

I am not planning to add more features currently as I am working on other projects.

Possible advancements could be:

Use of threading and an infinite generations button so the display updates every generation for as many as the user wants.
3D Game of life - You could use an arduino and a physical cube of LED's (if you have enough) to map the 3D representation.
etc.

I enjoyed making this, it didn't take me long!
